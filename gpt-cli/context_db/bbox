Bbox:
	Bbox class with bbox and anchor
	Args:
		bbox: numpy array of N x (x,y,w,h) -> Nx4
		anchor: BboxAnchor class (default bottomcenter)

	The bbox class can contain more bboxes for performance reasons: it takes less time to calculate
	the overlap or the extrapolation.

	Internally the bbox is stored as x,y,w,h. Other type (like x2, xcenter, x_anchor) are property functions.

	Examples:
		bbox1 = Bbox(np.array([[1,2,3,4]])) # use twice brackets [[ and ]] to make it a 1x4 Array

		bbox10x = Bbox(np.array([[1,2,3,4]]*10))
